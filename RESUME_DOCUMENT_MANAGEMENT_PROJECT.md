# Document Management & Collaboration Platform - Resume Bullet Points

## Project Description Options:

**Option 1 (Concise - 1-2 bullets):**
• Developed a document management system using Java Spring Boot and React, implementing file upload, version control, and user-based access permissions with PostgreSQL for data persistence
• Built RESTful APIs for document CRUD operations and integrated Elasticsearch for full-text search functionality, enabling users to quickly locate documents across the platform

**Option 2 (Detailed - 3-4 bullets):**
• Designed and implemented a document management platform using Java Spring Boot backend with React frontend, enabling users to upload, organize, and share documents with role-based access control
• Implemented document versioning system to track changes and maintain revision history, allowing users to revert to previous versions when needed
• Integrated Elasticsearch for full-text search capabilities, enabling users to search through document content and metadata efficiently
• Set up PostgreSQL database schema for document metadata storage and user management, with Docker containerization for easy deployment and development environment consistency

**Option 3 (Learning-Focused - Shows Growth):**
• Built a document management system using Java Spring Boot and React to learn full-stack development, implementing core features including file upload, document organization, and user authentication
• Implemented document versioning and access control features using PostgreSQL, allowing multiple users to collaborate while maintaining data integrity
• Integrated Elasticsearch for search functionality, learning how to configure and query a search engine for improved user experience
• Containerized the application using Docker for simplified deployment, gaining experience with containerization and microservices architecture

**Option 4 (Balanced - Professional but Realistic):**
• Developed a document management and collaboration platform using Java Spring Boot REST API with React frontend, implementing file upload, version control, and user permission management
• Implemented document search functionality using Elasticsearch integration, allowing users to perform full-text search across document content and metadata
• Designed and implemented PostgreSQL database schema for storing document metadata, user information, and access control relationships
• Containerized application components using Docker for consistent deployment across development and production environments

**Option 5 (Startup-Focused - Shows Practical Value):**
• Built a collaborative document management platform using Java Spring Boot and React, enabling teams to upload, organize, and share documents with granular access control
• Implemented document versioning and search capabilities using PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch, improving document discoverability and collaboration workflow
• Developed RESTful APIs following REST principles for document operations, authentication, and user management with proper error handling
• Containerized the application stack using Docker Compose, enabling easy deployment and scaling of database, backend, and search service components

## Recommended Selection:

**For a startup resume, I recommend Option 4 or Option 5** - they show:
- ✅ Practical skills without claiming expertise
- ✅ Modern tech stack (Spring Boot, React, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Docker)
- ✅ Real-world features (versioning, search, permissions)
- ✅ Shows understanding of deployment and architecture
- ✅ Professional tone without overstating skills

**Option 3** is good if you want to emphasize learning/growth mindset.
